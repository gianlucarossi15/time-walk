#### Unifying Graph Traversals and Time Series Joins in Hybrid Graphs repository code
This repository contains code and resources for the research paper "Unifying Graph Traversals and Time Series Joins in Hybrid Graphs" 
by Gianluca Rossi, Angela Bonifati, Riccardo Tommasini.

This work defines a declarative framework to express and evaluate queries that combine graph traversals and time series joins over hybrid graph data models.

The repository includes:
- Java code implementing the Time-Walk operator as a Java plugin, for enabling time series joins within graph traversals and for exmperimental evaluation.
- Python code for data preprocessing and plots.
- Ingestion scripts for loading hybrid graph data into a graph database.
